# fixing-a-paper-on-taxicab-numbers
This repo is meant to store chunks of my paper on taxicab numbers as I make new improvements to it.

This is an earlier version of my paper: 
- **A Closed-Form Symbolic Generator for $A^n + B^n = C^n + D^n$** (Jun 2025)  
  [arXiv:2506.19173](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19173v1) | [Harvard ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250619173A/abstract)

This is also a broader paper on the same topic I am also working on:
- **Generating Infinitely Many Taxicab Numbers Expressible as the Sum of Two Positive Cubes in Two Distinct Ways** (May 2025)
